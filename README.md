# Favorite-Artist-Blog

This is a blog website I created using html, css, and javascript.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to get more practice using html and css and styling a basic page.
I also wanted to test my mobile responsive skills.
This was a great way to test my skills of using classes to style a page.
I also found it useful to reuse classes throughout my webpage to make the styling process much quicker.
I have added basic vanilla javascript to give the webpage more functionality.
